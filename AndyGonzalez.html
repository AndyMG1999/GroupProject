	<p>Millennials are a slowly growing threat to everyone over the age of 30. Especially after the massacre of 2004, also known as the first year Facebook went live, people have begun to notice the formidable talents millennials present. "The Facebook" as it was known at the time, had full awareness of the unspeakable evil they'll release once they have introduced what is now known as "social media" into the public. We have recently visited Vidcon, a hellish landscape millennials use to celebrate their dark and mysterious practices like dabbing, and talking to a camera while pretending it's a person. Will we ever know what creates a millennial? Will times ever go back to my times that were totally simpler and better? All this and more may never be answered. </p>
